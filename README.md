# Daily Coding

Solutions to the Daily Coding Problems from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/.  I won't solve one striclty daily.  For each problem, I'll have a 60 minute time limit.  If I cannot solve it within that time, I'll have one file with the progress I made then another file with the solution after I've researched/figured it out.  I'll also (eventually) have a refactored solution for each problem, leaving my original solution.

## Languages

The languages used to solve each problem will each have their own folder and will have a solution to each problem.  I will progress through the solutions at different paces for each language as my skills and comfort in the language improve.

	* C
	* Ruby
	* JavaScript

## References Allowed

For each timed attempt, I will be allowed no external resources.  For those problems I cannot solve in the 60 minute time limit, I will allow only the docs or sites listed below.  The list is versioned and the solutions will note the version to which the comply.
