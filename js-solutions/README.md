# JavaScript Solutions

This folder contains the solutions to the Daily Coding Problems written in JavaScript.

## Rules

* I will complete each of these problems using no external resources.
* There is a 60 minute time limit.
* Each attempt, whether successful or not, will be pushed to the repo.
* Any unsuccessful attempt will be solved at a later date and the solution with a critique of my original attempt will be added to the problem folder and pushed to the repo.
* Solutions to originally unsuccessful attempts are allowed to use MDN docs as a reference only.

## Problem Listing

The problems are in the same order they are sent to me from Daily Coding Problems.  This list will be appended as each problem is solved.  Each problem will be marked with its number, difficulty (as described by DCP), completion status (either time to complete or "incomplete" if not finished before the time limit expires), and date (the date the original attempt was made).

Number	Difficulty	Date(dd/mm/yyy) Status
1.      Easy        26/04/2020      14:40
2.      Hard        10/05/2020      24:48
